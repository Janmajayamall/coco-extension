# COCO chrome extension

COCO is a moderation tool that warns you when any link on your google search/news, or article in your twitter feed, or webpage contains factually incorrect info/misinformation.

## Run COCO locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
npm install
npm run build
```

Go to **chrome:extensions** on Chrome. Click on **Load unpacked** on top left. Select the generated **build** folder. You should see the extension loaded.

Note - This requires **Developer Mode** set to ON on Chrome.
